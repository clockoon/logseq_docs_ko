- ## 소개
	- Logseq는 겉으로 보기에 간단해 보여도 실상은 굉장히 강력합니다. 그 유명한 마이크로소프트 엑셀과 비슷하게, Logseq는 생각하기를 위한 환경을 지향합니다. 엑셀의 힘이 숫자 블록에 있듯, **Logseq의 원동력은 글의 블록에 있습니다**.
	- 이 도구를 완전히 익히려면 시간이 좀 필요합니다. Logseq는 어떻게 사용해야 한다고 강요하지 않기 때문입니다. 그러나 당신이 원하는 최종적인 결과를 어떻게 얻을 수 있는지 파악한다면, **Logseq는 당신을 훨씬 더 효율적으로 생각할 수 있도록 만들어 줄 것입니다**.
	- 당신에게 적합한 워크플로우를 찾기 시작할 수 있도록, Logseq의 모든 핵심적인 기능들을 소개하겠습니다. 마치 도구상자에 들어있는 도구들을 보듯이 이 기능들을 살펴보세요. 각 도구들은 작은 역할을 하지만, 이들을 조합해서 어떻게 사용할 지 배우고 나면 당신은 예술가가 될 것입니다. **지식의 예술가 말입니다**.
	- Logseq의 기능을 들여다보기 전에, 먼저 무엇 때문에 Logseq가 특별하다는 건지 조금 더 알아봅시다. 앞에서 말했지만, Logseq는 겉보기엔 간단해 보입니다. 그러나 겉모습이 전부는 아닙니다.
- ## Logseq는 왜 특별한가?
	- **Logseq는 아웃라이너입니다**. 각 불릿은 블록 역할을 합니다. 문단에 빗대어 생각하면 가장 쉬울 것입니다. Logseq는 아웃라이너이기 때문에, Logseq에서 각 문단 앞에는 불릿이 붙습니다. 하나의 문단으로는 불충분한가요? _가지_를 쳐서, 연관된 블록을 묶어보세요. 
	- **Logseq는 _조직된_ 아웃라이너입니다**. 노트 컬렉션 안 어디에 있든지, 블록은 서로 연결할 수 있습니다. 블록을 복사하고 싶다면 마우스를 드래그하는 수준으로 쉽게 수행할 수 있습니다. 아이디어를 섞고 싶다면 금방 새로운 아웃라인을 만들어낼 수 있습니다. Logseq의 모든 요소는 결국 블록에 관한 것으로 귀결됩니다. 이 가이드 전체에 걸쳐 이 개념을 확인할 것입니다.
	- Logseq is different compared to traditional note-taking apps. Most notes tools try to emulate paper and folders, meaning that each note is located in precisely one folder. This makes remixing your notes difficult, and often leads to having several copies of slightly different notes. Logseq aims to solve this so you can focus on doing your best thinking.
	- In the coming lessons we’ll dive deep into what this freedom of information enables us to do. For now it’s enough to understand that **every bullet is a block** and that it can connect to any other block or collection of blocks (pages).

- ## Common use cases for Logseq
	- **Logseq does not impose a way of working.** Structure the tool in a way that matches _your_ way of thinking. By writing, grouping, and linking blocks, you create your own information structures. But if you just start out, you shouldn't worry too much about structure. **In Logseq, structure can _emerge_.**
	- Before you move your entire personal knowledge management system to Logseq, let's see what are some use cases to get started. We recommend you start small to see if you can shape Logseq to your way of thinking. As you become more proficient, you'll start to see the possibilities to use Logseq more.
	- Two common ways to get started with Logseq are note-taking and task management. With these core workflows and Logseq's features, you can support any other workflow for research, writing, or even running entire projects:
	- ### Note-taking
		- The absolute best way to get started with Logseq is by writing everything on the daily Journals page. Not only does this take away the decision on where to store a note, you can easily go back in time to revisit your notes.
		- Because it's so easy to link in Logseq using the `[[double brackets]]` or `#hashtag`, it doesn't matter where your notes are stored. You can easily link to anywhere in your notes collection, which is why proficient Logseq users write 99% of the time on their journals page. This is not the only way to use Logseq (remember: you can shape it any way you want), but it definitely is the best way when you just get started.
		- By using Logseq as a daily log, you quickly collect notes on a variety of topics. Most users start out by taking notes during meetings, to track tasks, or even manage entire projects. Logseq is also popular among researchers and writers. Synthesizing information is a joy as collecting and remixing blocks is easy.
	- ### Task management
		- As you write in Logseq, you might think of tasks you need to do later.  While you may use a dedicated tasks tool, a common use case for Logseq is task management.
		- **Combining your notes and tasks is a breeze in Logseq.** Not only can you create tasks, you can also track how much time you spend on them, and even create automated workflows using priorities or other tags.
		- Are your tasks mixed with your notes? No problem! [[Queries]] are a powerful way to resurface tasks and other information. But even as a beginning Logseq user can you benefit from tasks as you write on your daily Journals. To send a task to your future self, simply add a date link to quickly offload things from your mind (hint: type `/date picker` and hit `Enter` to easily add a future date to a task).
		- Once tasks start to cluster around projects, Logseq also has you covered. With the block-based approach, creating pages for projects is as easy as stacking blocks. And when you learn to use Logseq's powerful queries, you can effortlessly create dynamic indexes or task dashboards.
	- After seeing how others leverage Logseq's feature, you've hopefully started thinking of some of your own use cases. We recommend you continue following the rest of this starter guide to learn the core 20% functionality that will provide you with 80% of your wanted returns.
	- If you get stuck at any moment or if you just want to connect with fellow Logseq enthusiasts, [**join the Logseq Discord server**](https://discord.gg/sVsJdzJghp). There you'll always find someone friendly who's willing to help you better understand a Logseq feature or workflow. We look forward to getting to know you!
	- For now, let's get started by creating a graph.
- ## Create a graph
	- In Logseq, a collection of notes is called a _graph_. No need to worry if you don't know what a graph is or if you're not familiar with databases in general. All you need to know is that a graph is a collection of notes that are connected, i.e. there are links pointing between the notes.
	- As you progress through this starter guide, you'll see the power of the different ways of linking in Logseq. Through the links between your notes, you create a network. Not only does this network make finding notes easy, but the connections between different notes will provide a lot of value in themselves. More on that later.
